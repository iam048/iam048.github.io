                    <p>After reading some google and documentation i found meaning of those numbers :). Those are preserved numbering system to differentiate features and capabilities among various CPU's / GPU's and it's families.</p>

                <p>Discrete Graphics has its own VRAM for processing the Graphics it doesn't depend on the onboard RAM for its processing. Generally, if u see a 5.81 GB RAM availiable ram out of 8 GB RAM, it's directly indicates absence of discrete GPU because the GPU is fixed on borad called as intigrated GPU.</p>
                <p>Brand modifier indicates the basic features and capabilities of CPU family it varies as <span class="highlight-red">i3, i5, i7, i9</span>. the Higher modifier gives you the best basic features.</p>

                <p>SKU (Stock Keeping Unit) is the factor which tracks extra features and capabitlites included with chipset (Higher SKU number has more features in the same family)</p>
